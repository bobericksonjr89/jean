                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>Jean Baudrillard was a French intellectual, born in 1929 to a working-class family.  He studied German language and literature at the Sarbonne in Paris.  For a few years afterwards, he taught the same subjects in several differerent schools, and began to publish reviews and translations of German intellectuals, including, notably, Karl Marx.  Eventually, Buadrillard moved on to write a thesis on Sociology and became a professor at Paris X Nanterre where he wrote many of his influencial works.  In 1986 he took a position at the Institut de Recherche et d'Information Socio-Ã‰conomique.  He wrote prolifically, married twice, and passed away in 2005 from cancer.

            <h2>Sampling of Major Works</h2>
            <h3>For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign</h3>
            <p>Baudrillard expanded on Adam Smith and Karl Marx's analysis of commodity value, broadening the definition to include not only use-value and exchange-value, but also sign-value.  He argued that objects have a symbolic value relative to other subjects, and a sign value relative to a system of objects.  His influencial essay <em>The Ideological Genesis of Needs</em> explored the relationship between symblic and sign-values, production, and commodity fetishism.</p>

            <h3>Simulacra and Simulation</h3>
            <p>Simulacra and Simulation marked an even futher depature from the political-economy analysis of Marx.  In this complex work, he argued that all of our society's symbols and signs are references to objects that no longer or have never existed: a simulacra.  The function of the simulacra is to hide the absence of any real-world reference and instead to tautologically reference itself.  And therefore, our society is a mere simulation, or imitation, of symbol and sign-value, and in place of a shared reality of value-systems, we live in and share a delusion, a hyperreality.</p>

            <h3>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</h3>
            <p>In an eerily prescient analysis of the 1990's Gulf War, Baudrillard explores the idea that although the Gulf War did technically, physically take place (certainly for the victims of bombings, the Gulf War was very real), from the perspective of the average citizen of a western, developed country, it might as well have never existed at all.  Not only were there no tangible consequences referencing the fact that a devistating and violent bombing campaign occured, with a death toll of thousands of human lives, but also our intellectual experience of such an event possibly occuring was completely mediated by the media which warps true events into a simulated version of what actually transpired.</p>
